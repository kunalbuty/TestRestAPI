# # My Sample REST API
## Steps to Get Here
1) Follow this tutorial: [https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)
This will use springboot to initialize your rest API. 
2) Open with an IDE, and configure the project (I'm too lazy to explain how lol do it yourself). Should be pretty straightforward though.

## Important to note
* This isn't just a pure template, it also includes some firebase login stuff, but you can just change the contents of the **AuthUser** file to just return "hello" and delete the rest. That should work fine.
